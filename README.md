# Examples and resources

This project template includes data and code from a published article to illustrate good project organisation (Hughes, Cummins & Hussey, 2022, experiment 1). 

It uses RMarkdown ".Rmd" files over standard .R script files. To learn about RMarkdown and why it's great, see [here](https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v2/starting-with-r-markdown.html).
