The rawest available form of your data goes in this folder. For example, if you download data from Qualtrics, put the downloaded file here. Other than perhaps removing personally identifying information, it should not be altered. This ensures that the data processing and analysis are reproducible by others. 

Modified versions of the raw data (e.g., tidying and processing, whether in R or manually) should be saved in the 'processed' folder.

Data, codebooks, and RMarkdown scripts are provided are provided as an example of good project organisation. They come from Hughes, Cummins & Hussey (2022, experiment 1).  

This folder and its contents are a requirement of the psychDS data standard.
